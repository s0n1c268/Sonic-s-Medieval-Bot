Hi, it's been a while. I don't usually upload on github anymore due to me being busy. But, I agreed to put up this code for my friend ID because he was curious on how the bot works.
I will also put in instructions to get the code linked up to the bot. 

Linking Script To Bot App: 

1. Go to this website and login into it with your discord account credentials: https://discord.com/developers/applications 

2. Now press on Applications from the menu on the left side.

3. Press New Application on the top right of the screen and make4 a name for it. 

4. Press on Bot from left side menu and press reset token. This will generate a bot token you would then put where the bot token needs to go in the code. 

5. Now go to 0Auth2 from the left side menu and press bot in the scopes, then assign bot permission. I would just press on Administrator for bot permissions. 

6. Copy the Generated URL invite link at the bottom and invite the bot into the specific server you want it to be. 

7. Now just run the script and it will work. 

8. I won't be putting a tutorial on how to get node.js to work. This is assuming you have node.js knowledge and want to run your own discord.js bot. 

Let me know if you have any troubles. I will try my best to respond to pull requests, but don't expect me to be that active. 

Also like to put out that the insults and jokes were generated by ChatGPT. I'm way too lazy to come up with them.
